# OpenAI-Powered News-Feed Application: Basic Database Sharding & Production-Ready Setup

Harness the power of OpenAI's API with a state-of-the-art news-feed app. This robust multi-database solution is meticulously crafted using Django, Vue.js, and GraphQL, offering a scalable foundation for your projects.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Python 3.11.
- Install the Rust Programming Language.
- Install the MySQL (the simplest solution - XAMPP).
- Create a SQLite3 Database Folder: Create a folder named "sqlite3" in your Django backend directory and place all your databases inside it. You can find database aliases in the `django_backend/core/utils/database_config.py` file.

NOTE. I am using the VSCODE for testing setup, running scripts from `launch.json`, etc.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Advanced Database Management Starter**: The application features a foundational database sharding configuration, ensuring efficient data distribution and optimal performance.

## ðŸš€ What's Next?

- **Google Authentication**: Stay tuned for the upcoming integration of Google-based registration and login for a smoother user experience.
- **More Tests**: Expect additional tests to ensure application reliability.
- **Continuous Improvements**: I am always on the lookout for areas of improvement and am actively working on bug fixes.
